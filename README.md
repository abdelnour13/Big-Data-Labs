# Big-Data-Labs

In this repository, you will find my solutions and reports for all the labs of the "Big Data Technologies" course offered by the Higher School of Computer Science 08 May 1945 - Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 2nd upper cycle students specializing in "Artificial Intelligence and Data Science."

## Lab 01 : Hadoop MapReduce

In this very first Big Data Lab, we will explore Apache Hadoop and MapReduce basics.where we’ll understand managing vast data
efficiently. In today’s digital era, scalable solutions like Hadoop are essential for processing massive datasets. MapRe-
duce complements Hadoop by providing a powerful processing model. We’ll dive into setting up clusters, designing
MapReduce jobs.

## Lab 02 : Spark RDD

In this lab, we explored the configuration of a Spark cluster and the execution of RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
Python programs using both the local file system and the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Spark is a powerful
distributed computing framework that provides high-level APIs in Python, Java, and Scala for parallel data processing.
Understanding how to configure a Spark cluster and interact with different file systems is crucial for efficiently processing
large-scale datasets.
